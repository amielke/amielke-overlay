Terms and conditions

Last updated as of: June 13, 2012
Please read the following terms and conditions (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) carefully. These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services (as described below), and constitute a binding legal agreement between you, as a user of the Services and Insynchq Pte. Ltd., (“Insync”). Your access to and use of the Services is conditioned on your compliance with these Terms. By creating an Account and accessing and/or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

1. Services

Insync provides a file syncing and sharing service enabling you and/or your business to get access to your files, folders and other data from any browser, computer, mobile and tablet device. Insync comes with a web application and client (desktop, mobile, tablet) application to access, sync, share, publicly link, upload and download files, folders, attachments and other data (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;).

2. Registration

In order to access certain features of the Services and to post Content (as defined below), you must grant Insync access to your Google account via OAuth (&ldquo;Account&rdquo;). To create an Account you must be of legal age to form a binding contract. If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract, you may not register to use our Services. When you register, you will be asked to give Insync access to certain parts of your Google account. You are responsible for safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of your Google password and you agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You agree that you will be solely responsible for any activities or actions taken under your Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Insync of any unauthorized use of your password or your Account. You agree that the information that you provide to us upon registration and at all other times will be true, accurate, current and complete. By creating an Account you consent to the use of: (i) electronic means to complete these Terms and to provide you with any notices given pursuant to these Terms; and (ii) electronic records to store information related to these Terms or your use of the Services. Insync cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.
In order for Insync to provide you with certain Services (now or in the future), you have the option of providing Insync with your email address, password and/or access credentials to other accounts that you wish to link with your Account. Insync will only use these email addresses, passwords and/or access credentials to access your external accounts to the extent necessary to provide these Services and will otherwise keep your password/access credentials confidential.

3. Privacy

When you use the Service, Insync will collect certain personally identifiable information from you, which is hereby incorporated by reference. When you use the Services, Insync has access to, and in many cases will monitor, your usage of the Service as you send and receive Content. By using the Services, you have indicated that you agree that Insync may collect, use and disclose information you provide during your use of the Services. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.

* Information disclosure: We will not rent, sell, or share personally identifiable information about you with third parties. Non-identifiable information may be shared (i.e. anonymize) to third parties to provide Services.
* Log data: When you visit the Services, whether as an Insync Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, an &ldquo;Insync User&rdquo;), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (&ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;). This Log Data may include information such as your computer&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, browser type, error data, computer logging data or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Services, pages of our website and Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Services, access times and dates, and other statistics. In addition, our client application may send in whole or in part certain Log Data to our servers for analysis (e.g. to improve errors that a client application might be experiencing). We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Services' technical administration, to increase our Services' functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Services again, it will recognize you and serve information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Services meet the criteria required to process their requests.
* Cookies: Like many websites, we use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer&rsquo;s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Services. Second, we may utilize session and/or permanent ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Insync Users and web traffic routing on the Services. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or all functionality of the Services.
* Compliance with law enforcement: Since Insync doesn’t store any of your Content (except metadata and/or derived actions on said metadata) on our servers, any government and law enforcement officials will need to go directly to the organization responsible for holding your Content in order to get access to your Content. In other words, we don’t give access to anyone, including law enforcement, unless you tell us in writing. If you have any questions, please contact us at legal@insynchq.com.


4. Payment

There is a free and/or limited trial version of the Services and there will be a paid version. Insync reserves the right to change pricing with a 30 days prior notice to you.

5. Content

You are responsible for any files, folders, attachments and other data (“Content”) made available through the Services that you access, sync, share, publicly link, upload, download and otherwise submit to the Services and the consequences of posting or publishing it. In connection with your Content, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that you own or have the necessary rights to use and authorize Insync to use all rights in and to any and all of your Content in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms.
You retain all of your ownership rights to your Content. Insync doesn’t own your Content, you do.
However, you give us permission (and trusted third parties) to ensure Insync runs its Services properly (example: presenting metadata information, showing your Content properly on the web, etc.) or use in new features (example: music streaming, etc.). You also give us permission to use your Content to ensure Insync administers its servers and backend properly (example: back ups, etc.).

Insync does not endorse any Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Insync expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with any Content. Insync reserves the right, but not the obligation, to decide whether Content is appropriate and complies with these Terms, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscene or defamatory material, or excessive length. Insync may remove such Content and/or terminate your access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.
It is the policy of Insync to terminate your access to the Services if you infringe the copyright rights of others upon receipt of proper notification to Insync by the copyright owner or the copyright owner&rsquo;s legal agent. Without limiting the foregoing, if you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our Copyright Agent with the following information: (i) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Services; (iv) your address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner&rsquo;s behalf.
